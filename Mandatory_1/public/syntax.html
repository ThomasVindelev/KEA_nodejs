        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>We can use 3 different variable notations - only 2 of them being mutable options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>var</h4>
                        <p>This is a standard global variable notation. It can be referenced from anywhere, and is therefore not an ideal way of declaring variables.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>let</h4>
                        <p>The let notation is used for declaring variables inside a scope.</p>
                        <p>This means that the variable cannot be referenced in other scope or global namespace.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>const</h4>
                        <p>This notation states that the variable holds the value it is initiated with. It is therefore non-mutable.</p>
                        <p>A constant doesn't need the overhead memory that a standard variable needs, because the system knows that the value will never change.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Strings</h2>
                <p>Strings are pieces of text that can be worked with in different ways. They can contain all characters, as the characters, no matter their function, are turned into text.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Comma separated sentences</h4>
                        <p>Strings can be built as variables or in the console.</p>
                        <p>This way, javascript will insert spaces on it's own after the comma.</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>let firstName = "Thomas"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let lastName = "Vindelev"</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log("My first name is", firstName, "and my last name is", lastName)</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>// My first name is Thomas and my last name is Vindelev</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Template strings</h4>
                        <p>By using backticks (&nbsp;&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;) as string identifiers, we can inject variables into a string of text.</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>let firstName = "Thomas"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let lastName = "Vindelev"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let myName = `My name is ${firstName}`</span>

                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(myName)</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(`My first name is ${firstName} and my last name is ${lastName}`)</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>// My name is Thomas</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>// My first name is Thomas and my last name is Vindelev</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Parsing numbers from strings</h4>
                        <p>Using the parse methods we can cast and work with numerical values from strings.</p>
                        <p>However, we can only use these methods if the string only contains numbers and not letters.</p>
                        <p>Parsing numbers from strings including text will result in NaN (not a number).</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>var numberOne = "1.10"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>var numberTwo = "2.30"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(parseFloat(numberOne) + parseFloat(numberTwo))</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>// 3.4</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Objects</h2>
                <p>Objects can store key-value pairs. These can contain regular data types such as strings or numbers, but they can also contain functions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Javascript objects</h4>
                        <p>Objects in Javascript can be declared with or without key-value pairs.</p>
                        <p>In this example an object is created holding my name and age.</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>let javascriptObject = {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "Thomas Skovgaard Vindelev",</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 24</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>}</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>JSON objects</h4>
                        <p>Javascript objects and JSON objects look very similar, but the difference is that JSON needs every key to have quotation marks.</p>
                        <p>Data types such as integers or floats don't need to be annotated with quotation marks, since they're numerical values.</p>
                        <p>Because JSON is used so frequently in combination with Javascript we often just use the JSON way of creating objects.</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>let jsonObject = {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Thomas Skovgaard Vindelev",</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 24</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>}</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Accessing objects</h4>
                        <p>Adding, modifying or deleting values in an object is possible in several ways.</p>
                        <p>We can add values at the creation of the object, or we can add them later.</p>
                        <p>In this example I made the empty object myObject. Then I gave it a key named <b>newItem</b> with a value of 10, then I modified it and deleted it.</p>
                        <div id="code">
                            <span>let myObject = {}</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>myObject["newItem"] = 10</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>myObject.newItem = 20</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>delete myObject.newItem</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
