        <h1>Syntax documentation</h1>
        <p>Javascript syntax is not that different from Java, however it's very different in terms of what we're allowed to do and how we can do it.</p>
        <p>For starters we are very used to the idea of working with different classes as objects.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>We can use 3 different variable notations - only 2 of them being mutable options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>var</h3>
                        <p>This is a standard global variable notation. It can be referenced from anywhere, and is therefore not an ideal way of declaring variables.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>let</h3>
                        <p>The let notation is used for declaring variables inside a scope.</p>
                        <p>This means that the variable cannot be referenced in other scope or global namespace.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>const</h3>
                        <p>This notation states that the variable holds the value it is initiated with. It is therefore non-mutable.</p>
                        <p>A constant doesn't need the overhead memory that a standard variable needs, because the system knows that the value will never change.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Strings</h2>
                <p>Strings are pieces of text that can be worked with in different ways. They can contain all characters, as the characters, no matter their function, are turned into text.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Comma separated sentences</h3>
                        <p>Strings can be built as variables or in the console.</p>
                        <p>This way, javascript will insert spaces on it's own after the comma.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let firstName = "Thomas"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let lastName = "Vindelev"</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log("My first name is", firstName, "and my last name is", lastName)</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span><span>// My first name is Thomas and my last name is Vindelev</span></span>
                        </div> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Template strings</h3>
                        <p>By using backticks (&nbsp;&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;) as string identifiers, we can inject variables into a string of text.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let firstName = "Thomas"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let lastName = "Vindelev"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let myName = `My name is ${firstName}`</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(myName)</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(`My first name is ${firstName} and my last name is ${lastName}`)</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span><span>// My name is Thomas</span></span>
                            <br>
                            <span><span>// My first name is Thomas and my last name is Vindelev</span></span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Parsing numbers from strings</h3>
                        <p>Using the parse methods we can cast and work with numerical values from strings.</p>
                        <p>However, we can only use these methods if the string only contains numbers and not letters.</p>
                        <p>Parsing numbers from strings including text will result in NaN (not a number).</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let numberOne = "1.10"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>let numberTwo = "2.30"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>console.log(parseFloat(numberOne) + parseFloat(numberTwo))</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span><span>// 3.4</span></span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Objects</h2>
                <p>Objects can store key-value pairs. These can contain regular data types such as strings or numbers, but they can also contain functions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Javascript objects</h3>
                        <p>Objects in Javascript can be declared with or without key-value pairs.</p>
                        <p>In this example an object is created holding my name and age.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let javascriptObject = {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "Thomas Skovgaard Vindelev",</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 24</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>}</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>JSON objects</h3>
                        <p>Javascript objects and JSON objects look very similar, but the difference is that JSON needs every key to have quotation marks.</p>
                        <p>Data types such as integers or floats don't need to be annotated with quotation marks, since they're numerical values.</p>
                        <p>Because JSON is used so frequently in combination with Javascript we often just use the JSON way of creating objects.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let jsonObject = {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Thomas Skovgaard Vindelev",</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 24</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>}</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Accessing objects</h3>
                        <p>Adding, modifying or deleting values in an object is possible in several ways.</p>
                        <p>We can add values at the creation of the object, or we can add them later.</p>
                        <p>In this example I made the empty object myObject. Then I gave it a key named <b>newItem</b> with a value of 10, then I modified it and deleted it.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>let myObject = {}</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>myObject["newItem"] = 10</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>myObject.newItem = 20</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>delete myObject.newItem</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Storing functions in objects</h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Functions</h2>
                <p>Functions are used to execute a number of tasks when called. Functions are also objects, as variables can be assigned at functions.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, functions can be passed into functions as <b>callback functions.</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Callback functions</h3>
                        <p>A callback function is injected into another functions arguments. These methods can also be defined directly in the arguments.</p>
                        <p>Because functions are objects we can parse different methods into other methods, in which they will be executed when the initial function tells it to.</p>
                        <p>The callbacks can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on when the callback function will execute.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Loops</h2>
                <p>Loops can be used to run a block of code several times with, sometimes, different outcomes.</p>
                <p>The most common loops in Javascript are for-loops and while-loops</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>For-loop</h3>
                        <p>A for-loop is characterized by the keyword <b>for</b> in front of the statement itself.</p>
                        <p>The loop often relies on an incrementer, but can also be done as a <b>for/in</b>-loop.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span><span>for-loop</span></span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span>for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello, number",i)</span>

                        </div>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span><span>for/in-loop</span></span>

                </ul>
                <p>For-loops in Javascript are similar to the ones we find in Java.</p>
                <p>However we don't need to declare i as an integer, as Java and Javascript don't have the same rules regarding data types.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>Arrays are collections that can hold different values. Different data types can be stored in the same array.</p>
                <p>Javascript arrays has a bunch of inherited methods that can be used to achieve different results.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Index</h3>
                        <p>To access data in an array we need to specify the index in which the desired data is located.</p>
                        <p>Since we can also store objects in an array, can parse a function from an array.</p>
                        <div class="code">
