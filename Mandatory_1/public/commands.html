        <h1>Commands and keywords documentation</h1>
        <p>Working with node.js we're using a lot of different terminal commands to navigate, manage and execute files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>npm (Node Package Manager)</h2>
                <p>npm is a package manager for Javascript. Using the <b>package.json</b> file, it can identify and fetch all the required dependencies for a given project.</p>
                <p>It can also be used for running scripts defined inside the package.json script section.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>npm i</h3>
                        <p>This command installs all dependencies defined in the package.json file. These are then downloaded from the npm website and added to a folder named <b>node_modules</b>.</p>
                        <p>We can use both <b>npm i</b> or <b>npm install</b>. This makes no difference, since it's just an abbreviation:</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ npm i</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>$ npm install</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>If we just want to fetch libraries directly from the command-line, we can type the name of the library after <b>npm i</b>. These will then be added to both package.json and node_modules:</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ npm i express</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>npm run</h3>
                        <p>The <b>run</b> command is used to run scripts from the package.json file. These scripts can be useful, but they can also work differently depending on your operating system.</p>
                        <p>Defining the scripts:</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>"scripts": {</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start": "cross-env PORT=80 node app.js",</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 nodemon app.js"</span>
                            <br>
                            <span>}</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>The <b>cross-env</b> tag is another dependency - fetched by npm - which allows this way of forcing ports to work independently of the operating system.</p>
                        <p>Running the scripts:</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ npm run start-dev</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>npm init</h3>
                        <p>By using this command, we don't need no longer need to declare the package.json ourselves.</p>
                        <p>However this isn't necessary in the first place, since <b>npm i [packagename]</b> also will create the file.</p>
                        <p>It's is useful for publishing npm packages.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Running files</h2>
                <p>Running .js files can be done in different ways, but we can also run html-files without the need of an express server.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>node</h3>
                        <p>By using <b>node [filename]</b> we can run our .js files, which can act as a server for a website or execute methods.</p>
                        <p>This commands needs to be executed inside the folder with the desired .js target.</p>
                        <p>If we were to launch a website this way, we would need to manually relaunch the site if changes were made to the files in action.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ node app.js</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>nodemon</h3>
                        <p>nodemon is a project dependency which can be fetched by using <b>npm nodemon</b>.</p>
                        <p>Using <b>nodemon [filename]</b> to execute our .js files, we are no longer required to manually re-run them in the terminal, since this is done automatically.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ nodemon app.js</span>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>budo</h3>
                        <p>If we want to launch html-files and keep them updating while editing, we can use budo-commands to do so.</p>
                        <p>budo doesn't update the back-end of your server, but will almost instantly update your html files in the browser.</p>
                        <p>This makes budo ideal for rapid html and CSS development.</p>
                        <p>budo has several tags, in the example --live and --open are being used.</p>
                        <p>--live enables LiveReload and --open makes the browser open automatically.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <span>$ npx budo app.js --live --open</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>We use the <b>npx</b> command to run budo. This way we won't install it globally.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h2>Express</h2>
                <p>Express is a lightweight node.js tool for serving websites. It supports the different request methods that we look for in REST.</p>
                <p>We can fetch Express by using the npm-library. We can simply type in <b>npm install express</b> into the terminal.</p>
                <p>However we need to use the require()-method to actually make use of Express.</p>
                <p>Also, we need some setup before we can run the actual server. This includes setting up a method that listens for activity on a certain port. In our case we use port 3000.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>const express = require("express")</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>const app = express()</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'))</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>const server = app.listen(3000, (error) => {</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (error) {</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Server failed")</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else {</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Launched on port ${port}`)</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>})</span>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>We can now setup our first get method, which will in most cases be for the index page of our html.</p>
                <p>In this function we create a callback function which takes the request and response as it's parameters.</p>
                <p>This allows us to set the response to what we want the user to fetch.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>app.get("/", (req, res) => {</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/index.html")</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>})</span>
                </div>
            </li>

                        <h3>cd [foldername]</h3>
                        <p>cd means "change directory". This changes the current folder to the specified location.</p>
