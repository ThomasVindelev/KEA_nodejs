                <h2>What is REST?</h2>

                    <li>
                        <h3>JSON</h3>
                        <p>Objects requested from REST APIs will be returned as JSON-objects. This is what defines a REST API.</p>
                        <p>JSON-objects are made up of, typically, keys and values. Though they can also be </p>

                <h2>Requests</h2>
                <p>We usually navigate websites by going through different pages, messaging someone, or making changes in online documents.</p>
                <p>By making use of different CRUD-features on websites we are simultaniously sending or retrieving data from a web server trhough requests.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Get</h4>
                        <p>This commonly used request is used to retrieve information from a server.</p>
                        <p>Our client is making as get request when we, for example, want to visit a website.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Post</h4>
                        <p>Whenever we send a message through an online communication platform we are asking the server to store and send our message.</p>
                        <p>This is a post request. We are not asking the server for information, but rather providing it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Put</h4>
                        <p>The put request is used to update online ressources.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Delete</h4>
                        <p>Like the name suggests, the delete request asks the server to remove a certain element from it's ressources.</p>
                        <p>For example this would be used to delete posts on Facebook.</p>
                    </li>
